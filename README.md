[![Build Status](https://drone.fap.no/api/badges/kradalby/erlsrcds/status.svg)](https://drone.fap.no/kradalby/erlsrcds)

Library for performing server queries towards Source Dedicated Servers.

The library is implemented based on the information given here: [Server queries](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries). Note that it is implemented with Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 in mind, so I am not sure about non-valve Source enginge games.

This project was created for educational purposes, but should function properly.
If there are parts of the code which has not optimal implementations, please let me know :). I have tested it on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike: Source.

This project was a part of my final project in Analysis of Concurrent Systems at Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid. The presentation can be found [here](https://kradalby.no/presentations/upm/erlang/final/#1).

## Usage
The library allows you to query a server and get information back in form of a map or a list.

### Information
To fetch information from the server:

    erlsrcds:info("193.202.115.74", 27127).
        #{"appid" => 730,
        "dedicated" => "d",
        "edf" => 49,
        "gamedesc" => "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive",
        "gamedir" => "csgo",
        "hostname" => "Recess.no #06 Arena 3 Multi-1v1 [ 128 Tick | NOR | Ranking ]",
        "map" => "am_aztec2",
        "maxplayers" => 20,
        "numbots" => 0,
        "numplayers" => 3,
        "os" => "l",
        "passworded" => 0,
        "secure" => 1}

The information is returned as a map.


### Players
To fetch players from the server:

    erlsrcds:player("193.202.115.74", 27125).
        [#{"index" => 0,
           "kill" => 8,
           "name" => "NeXT /T/",
           "time" => 853.4295654296875},
         #{"index" => 0,"kill" => 9,"name" => "VANGUARD","time" => 1222.013427734375},
         #{"index" => 0,"kill" => 6,"name" => "Mucto","time" => 1268.7869873046875},
         #{"index" => 0,"kill" => 3,"name" => "Hunter","time" => 2149.594970703125},
         #{"index" => 0,"kill" => 6,"name" => "Bystman","time" => 2876.09130859375},
         #{"index" => 0,
           "kill" => 0,
           "name" => "SUPER BUCK winaskin.com",
           "time" => 4056.263916015625}]

The players are returned as list with maps.

### Rules
To fetch rules from the server:

    erlsrcds:rules("193.202.115.74", 27015).
        #{"sbchecker_version" => "SB-1.5.2F",
          "sm_advertisements_version" => "0.6",
          "mp_friendlyfire" => "0",
          "mp_holiday_nogifts" => "0",
          "mp_forceautoteam" => "0",
          "mp_teamplay" => "0",
          "bot_quota" => "6",
          "mpbhops_enable" => "0",
          "mpbhops_color" => "0",
          "mp_hostagepenalty" => "13",
          "mp_autocrosshair" => "1",
          "r_JeepViewDampenFreq" => "7.0",
          "mp_winlimit" => "0",
          "r_AirboatViewDampenDamp" => "1.0",
          "mp_weaponstay" => "0",
          "mp_teamlist" => "hgrunt;scientist",
          "mp_autoteambalance" => "0",
          "mp_startmoney" => "1337",
          "mp_tournament" => "0",
          "slopefix_enable" => "1",
          "mp_timelimit" => "60",
          "mp_scrambleteams_auto_windifference" => "2",
          "mp_freezetime" => "1",
          "mboosterfix_version" => "0.9.1",
          "mp_flashlight" => "1",
          "mp_stalemate_enable" => "0",
          "r_JeepViewDampenDamp" => "1.0",
          "deathmatch" => "1",
          [...] => [...],...}

The rules are returned as a map.

### RCON
The library implements a _very_ simple RCON interface.

This interface miss a lot of error handling, and it does not support split packages. This means that you can basically set and get small parameters, but not get log or status. For status, use info.


    1> erlsrcds:rcon("sv_gravity", "passwrd", "127.0.0.1", 27015).
    "\"sv_gravity\" = \"200\" ( def. \"800\" ) game notify replicated       - World gravity.\n"
    2> erlsrcds:rcon("sv_gravity 800", "passwrd", "127.0.0.1", 27015).
    []
    3> erlsrcds:rcon("sv_gravity", "passwrd", "127.0.0.1", 27015).
    "\"sv_gravity\" = \"800\" game notify replicated                  - World gravity.\n"

The return value is the return value from the server as a string.
